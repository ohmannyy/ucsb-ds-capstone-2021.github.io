# Update 1
## CSEP Project Update
### Goals
CSEP does not have any specific goals when it comes to using their data. Here are some possible avenues we can explore:  
1. Outcomes by Major  
2. Ranking of Graduate Schools UCSB students attend
    * Engineering Students in Grad School
3. Job Opportunites
4. Geographical Distribution of Students
    * By Major
    * By Admit Status
    * By career choice
5. Freshmen vs. Transfer Admit Outcomes  

While these are our goals, we have made some progress working towards some of these, yet this is only the beginning.

### Engineering Students in Grad School
Since a big part of the project has been tracking the progress of stem majors, we thought it was a good idea to take a look at how many engineering students has earned some sort of graduate degree. This does not consider graduate students that are currently attending nor those that received a professional/teaching degree. The goal of this was to see if the number of engineering students obtaining a graduate degree has decreased over the years. A big reason for this has been engineers seem to pursue jobs in industry since its a readily available opportunity after obtaining a BS degree.

    In the plot, we can see the increasing number of students who obtain their MS degree.

### Freshmen vs. Transfer Admit Outcomes  
Many people believe that transferring to a 4 year college because of the amount of money saved. Others believe attending a 4 year university for the full 4 years is the way to go. Taking a quick glance at the data we can see some differences. First we see transfer students obtaining Minors and Bachelors of Science at a higher rate than Freshmen admits. Meanwhile, Freshmen Admits have a higher rate of receiving Bachelors of Art, Bachelors of Fine Arts, and Bachelors of Music.

Also, there appears to be differences in degree types. The biggest being Transfers tend to have a higher rate of biology majors.

Finally, Freshmen admits also seem to work more in similar institutions with their peers.
