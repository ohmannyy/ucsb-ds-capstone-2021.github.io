# Update 1
## CSEP Project Update
### Goals
CSEP does not have any specific goals when it comes to using their data. Here are some possible avenues we can explore:  
1. Outcomes by Major  
2. Ranking of Graduate Schools UCSB students attend
    * Graduate Engineering Students
3. Job Opportunites
4. Geographical Distribution of Students
    * By Major
    * By Admit Status
    * By career choice
5. Freshmen vs. Transfer Admit Outcomes
6. Greek life vs Non-Greek life Students

While these are our goals, we have made some progress working towards some of these, yet this is only the beginning.

### Graduate Engineering Students
Since a big part of the project has been tracking the progress of stem majors, we thought it was a good idea to take a look at how many engineering students has earned some sort of graduate degree. This does not consider graduate students that are currently attending nor those that received a professional/teaching degree. The goal of this was to see if the number of engineering students obtaining a graduate degree has decreased over the years. A big reason for this has been engineers seem to pursue jobs in industry since its a readily available opportunity after obtaining a BS degree.

    In the plot, we can see the increasing number of students who obtain their MS degree.

### Freshmen vs. Transfer Admit Outcomes  
Many people believe that transferring to a 4 year college because of the amount of money saved. Others believe attending a 4 year university for the full 4 years is the way to go. Taking a quick glance at the data we can see some differences. First we see transfer students obtaining Minors and Bachelors of Science at a higher rate than Freshmen admits. Meanwhile, Freshmen Admits have a higher rate of receiving Bachelors of Art, Bachelors of Fine Arts, and Bachelors of Music.

```
 
Also, there appears to be differences in degree types. The biggest being Transfers tend to have a higher rate of biology majors.

Finally, Freshmen admits also seem to work more in similar institutions with their peers.
