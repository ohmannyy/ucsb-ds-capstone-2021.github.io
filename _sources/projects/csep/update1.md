## CSEP Center for Science and Engineering Partnerships  
### Introduction  
CSEP tracks students after they have completed their undergraduate education at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The overall goal of tracking students is monitoring opportunites UCSB provides and the impact on student outcomes. The data comes from a mix of sources: online - LinkedIn, personal websites, and professional organizations - and UCSB's own information about students.
