# Update 1
## CSEP Project Update
### Goals
CSEP does not have any specific goals when it comes to using their data. Here are some possible avenues we can explore:  
1. Outcomes by Major  
2. Ranking of Graduate Schools UCSB students attend
    * Graduate Engineering Students
3. Job Opportunites
4. Geographical Distribution of Students
    * By Major
    * By Admit Status
    * By career choice
5. Freshmen vs. Transfer Admit Outcomes
6. Greek life vs Non-Greek life Students
7. Career outcomes for athletes 
    * Female athletes in leadership roles 
8. Students from low-income high schools 
    * Distribution by undergradute major 
    * Career outcomes and future earnings 

While these are our goals, we have made some progress working towards some of these, yet this is only the beginning.

### Graduate Engineering Students
Since a big part of the project has been tracking the progress of stem majors, we thought it was a good idea to take a look at how many engineering students has earned some sort of graduate degree. This does not consider graduate students that are currently attending nor those that received a professional/teaching degree. The goal of this was to see if the number of engineering students obtaining a graduate degree has decreased over the years. A big reason for this has been engineers seem to pursue jobs in industry since its a readily available opportunity after obtaining a BS degree.

    In the plot, we can see the increasing number of students who obtain their MS degree.

### Freshmen vs. Transfer Admit Outcomes  
Many people believe that transferring to a 4 year college because of the amount of money saved. Others believe attending a 4 year university for the full 4 years is the way to go. Taking a quick glance at the data we can see some differences. First we see transfer students obtaining Minors and Bachelors of Science at a higher rate than Freshmen admits. Meanwhile, Freshmen Admits have a higher rate of receiving Bachelors of Art, Bachelors of Fine Arts, and Bachelors of Music.

```
 
Also, there appears to be differences in degree types. The biggest being Transfers tend to have a higher rate of biology majors.

Finally, Freshmen admits also seem to work more in similar institutions with their peers.

### Undergraduate Students from Low-Income High Schools 
High schools throughout California are far from equal in terms of how they prepare students for college. Additionally, most high schools serving underprivlaged students lack stong STEM programs and few offer computer science classes. [A study by the Kapor Center](https://www.kaporcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Computer-Science-in-California-Schools.pdf)    found that high schools where most students are black, Latino and Native America, only 39 percent offer computer science courses, compared with 72 percent of schools where white or Asian students make up the majority. Additionally, Computer science courses are more often offered at high-income schools (55 percent) than at low-income schools (35 percent.) Do students who atteneded high-income highshcools have an advantage when it comes to being admitted to UCSB's College of Engieering? Are students from low-income high shcools being served equally by UCSB's STEM programs?
