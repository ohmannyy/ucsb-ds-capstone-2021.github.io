# Update 1
## CSEP Project Update
### Goals
CSEP does not have any specific goals when it comes to using their data. Here are some possible avenues we can explore:  
1. Outcomes by Major  
2. Ranking of Graduate Schools UCSB students attend
    * Graduate Engineering Students
3. Job Opportunites
4. Geographical Distribution of Students
    * By Major
    * By Admit Status
    * By career choice
5. Freshmen vs. Transfer Admit Outcomes
6. Greek life vs Non-Greek life Students

While these are our goals, we have made some progress working towards some of these, yet this is only the beginning.

### Graduate Engineering Students
Since a big part of the project has been tracking the progress of stem majors, we thought it was a good idea to take a look at how many engineering students has earned some sort of graduate degree. This does not consider graduate students that are currently attending nor those that received a professional/teaching degree. The goal of this was to see if the number of engineering students obtaining a graduate degree has decreased over the years. A big reason for this has been engineers seem to pursue jobs in industry since its a readily available opportunity after obtaining a BS degree.

    In the plot, we can see the increasing number of students who obtain their MS degree.

### Freshmen vs. Transfer Admit Outcomes  
Many people believe that transferring to a 4 year college because of the amount of money saved. Others believe attending a 4 year university for the full 4 years is the way to go. Taking a quick glance at the data we can see some differences. First we see transfer students obtaining Minors and Bachelors of Science at a higher rate than Freshmen admits. Meanwhile, Freshmen Admits have a higher rate of receiving Bachelors of Art, Bachelors of Fine Arts, and Bachelors of Music.

```
 
Also, there appears to be differences in degree types. The biggest being Transfers tend to have a higher rate of biology majors.

Finally, Freshmen admits also seem to work more in similar institutions with their peers.

### Greek life vs Non-Greek life Students
A talking point, before the pandemic, for high-school seniors before choosing UCSB has frequently been Greek Life. I remember when I barely knew of UCSB academics, I was well informed of the Greek Life culture that has accumluated here. Some times that culture can be an incentive to come here and for others not so much. It is for these reasons we decided to look into the data around Greek life. 

In the data set, it was found that there is quite a substantial difference in the amount of data for those who did Greek Life compared to those who didn't. For every student who participated in Greek Life, there is data for 6 students who did not partake during their time at UCSB. 

Out of students who did partake in Greek Life at UCSB, it was found that 45.73 % of those individuals are still currently employed. Looking at the individuals who didn't participate in Greek Life at UCSB, it was found that around 41.32 % of those individuals are still currently employed. While the Greek Life students have a higher percentage of individuals who are still employed, we have to still consider that there is a much larger dataset for those who didn't partake.
