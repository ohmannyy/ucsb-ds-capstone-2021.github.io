## CSEP Center for Science and Engineering Partnerships  
### Introduction  
The CSEP Alumni Tracking Project tracks students graduating from  XXXX - XXXX from the University of California, Santa Barbara. The overall goal of tracking students is monitoring opportunites UCSB provides and the impact on student outcomes. The data comes from a mix of sources: online - LinkedIn, personal websites, and professional organizations - and UCSB's own information about students. The organization providing the data does not have an overall goal for the outcome of the data: the CSEP group is free to explore any possible avenue for the data within reason.  
### Goals
As stated above CSEP does not have any specific goals when it comes to using their data. Here are some possible avenues we can explore:  
1. Outcomes by Major  
2. Graduate Schools UCSB students attend
3. Job Opportunites
4. Geographical Distribution of Students
    * By Major
    * By Admit Status
    * By career choice
5. Freshmen vs. Transfer Admit Outcomes  
### Freshmen vs. Transfer Admit Outcomes  
Many people believe that transferring to a 4 year college because of the amount of money saved. Others believe attending a 4 year university for the full 4 years is the way to go. Taking a quick glance at the data we can see some differences. First we see transfer students obtaining Minors and Bachelors of Science at a higher rate than Freshmen admits. Meanwhile, Freshmen Admits have a higher rate of receiving Bachelors of Art, Bachelors of Fine Arts, and Bachelors of Music.

Also, there appears to be differences in degree types. The biggest being Transfers tend to have a higher rate of biology majors.

Finally, Freshmen admits also seem to work more in similar institutions with their peers.
