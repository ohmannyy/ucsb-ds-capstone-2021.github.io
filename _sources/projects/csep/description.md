The CSEP Alumni Tracking project looks at data from students who have graduated from UCSB in XXXX - XXXX ranging from all majors. It also takes a look at if you pursued a graduate degree of some kind or if you are currently working in industry. The overall goal of this project is to understand post-bachelor academic and career paths of UCSB alumni. Most of the data we have collected is on STEM alumni because of funding of the project in the past.
